          <h3>What is tourism?</h3>
          <img

          />
          <p>
            Tourism is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and
            practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and
            entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours.
          </p>
          <p>
            the World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, in
            terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being
            limited to holiday activity only", as people "traveling to and
            staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than
            one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours,
            business and other purposes".
          </p>
          <p>
            Tourism can be domestic (within the traveller's own country) or
            international, and international tourism has both incoming and
            outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments.

          <h3>Tourism in the era of Covid-19</h3>
          <img

            alt="tourism-in-the-era-of-covid-19-image"
          />
          <p>
            Tourism numbers declined as a result of a strong economic slowdown
            (the late-2000s recession) between the second half of 2008 and the
            end of 2009, and in consequence of the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1
            influenza virus, but slowly recovered until the COVID-19 pandemic
            put an abrupt end to the growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The United Nations World Tourism Organization estimated that global
            international tourist arrivals might decrease by 58% to 78% in 2020,
            leading to a potential loss of US$0.9–1.2 trillion in international
            tourism receipts.

          <h3>Income from tourism</h3>
          <img
            src="https://www.toonpool.com/user/1631/files/tourism_makes_the_world_go_round_2642765.jpg"
            alt="income-from-tourism-image"
          />
          <p>
            Globally, international tourism receipts (the travel item in balance
            of payments) grew to US$1.03 trillion (€740 billion) in 2005,
            corresponding to an increase in real terms of 3.8% from 2010.
          </p>
          <p>
            With international tourist arrivals surpassing the 1 billion mark
            globally for the first time in 2012, these markets have increased
            their spending significantly over the past decade.
          </p>
          <p>Emerging markets of origin such as</p>
          <ul>
            <li>China</li>
            <li>Russia</li>
            <li>Brazil</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Global tourism accounts for c. 8% of global greenhouse-gas
            emissions. Emissions as well as other significant environmental and
            social impacts are not always beneficial to local communities and
            their economies. For this reason, many tourist development
            organizations have begun to focus on sustainable tourism in order to
            mitigate the negative effects caused by the growing impact of
            tourism.
          </p>
          <p>
            The United Nations World Tourism Organization emphasized these
            practices by promoting tourism as part of the Sustainable
            Development Goals, through programs like the International Year for
            Sustainable Tourism for Development in 2017, and programs like
            Tourism for SDGs focusing on how SDG 8, SDG 12 and SDG 14 implicate
            tourism in creating a sustainable economy.

            Cultural heritage tourism (or just heritage tourism) is a branch of
            tourism oriented towards the cultural heritage of the location where
            tourism is occurring.
          </p>
          <p>
            The National Trust for Historic Preservation in the United States
            defines heritage tourism as "traveling to experience the places,
            artifacts and activities that authentically represent the stories
            and people of the past", and "heritage tourism can include cultural,
            historic and natural resources".

            Recreation is an activity of leisure, leisure being discretionary
            time. The "need to do something for recreation" is an essential
            element of human biology and psychology. Recreational activities are
            often done for enjoyment, amusement, or pleasure and are considered
            to be "fun".

            Religious tourism, spiritual tourism, sacred tourism, or faith
            tourism, is a type of tourism with two main subtypes: pilgrimage,
            meaning travel for religious or spiritual purposes, and the viewing
            of religious monuments and artefacts, a branch of sightseeing.
